"""Lore knowledge graph and the writers' room persona chain.

The lore graph is the studio's canon of record. Per the architecture audit it
is backed by a :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph` keyed by relation type (finding
B2: a plain ``DiGraph`` holds one edge per ordered pair and silently
overwrites parallel relations), persisted as atomic node-link JSON instead of
a Neo4j server (finding M5), and queried through a character-budgeted canon
brief rather than a full graph dump (finding A3). Symmetric relations such as
``ALLIED_WITH`` are stored once and normalized at query time so canon is
visible from both endpoints.

The writers' room implements the audit's M1 correction: the four "agents" are
prompt personas serialized onto the single resident LLM, not four model
instances. :class:`WritersRoom` therefore takes an *injected* async callable
``(prompt, system_prompt) -> response`` and never imports the pool
coordinator.
